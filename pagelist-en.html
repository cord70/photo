      Sometimes you see its tail, sometimes it digs under gravel
                    entirely. In gravel the fish may hide from you when you do something
                    in the tank. </li>

     While photographing Sun, before the
                lens I hold a filter made of a diskette. Such a filter is dark-red,
                it decreases light down to 2000 times. Later I tune white balance. </li>
