    The HP C200 camera doesn't have a special macro
            lens. So I took this photo through
    <span class="formula">
     a magnifying
                glass </span> . </p>

   <h4> What is it ?

   <p> It is a normal screw for computer's cover.

   <p> The photos below are made by a
    <b> Nikon CP880 </b> . The
            camera's minimal distance is 4cm. So sometimes I use a loupe too.
            The mosquito is taken through a loupe from distance about 2-3cm.
            The bumblebee is taken without a loupe from distance 8-10cm. </p>
