   <h2> A plastic tank cave for tropical fish </h2>

     <br> Female
     <i> Pelvicachromis pulcher </i> <br> watches its fry near the cave </a> </p>

   <p> It's an easy construction. There are many holes for fish,
            especially for those who like darkness and narrow holes (mostly
            catfish do, which dormant all day long) </p>

   <p> Black color hides not very dense attachment of stones. It
            is better to use black plastic but I painted white air ducts. </p>

   <p> The cave is made of rectangular and round plastic pipes. Total
            size is about 40x30x20 cm. Parts of pipes are connected by plastic
            ties. Also you may use black aquarium silicone sealant. </p>

      covered by small stones" height="300" src="600/fish_home_sand-400.jpg" title="the cave is covered by gravel" width="400"> </p>

   <p> Visible surface is covered by gravel from the same tank. The
            gravel was previously washed, boiled and dried for better grasp
            with sealant. </p>

   <p> Gravel fills specially made pots which was then planted. You
            may place here a piece of clay as enrichment for plants. </p>

   <p> Firstly you may attach some plants by green thread. Vallisneria
            itself climbs up by its roots. </p>

   <p> The last picture is my 100L aquarium with a version of such
            cave. Here

     cichlids and barbuses </a>
    spawned. You see that vallisneria grasps plastic pipes covered
            by gravel. </p>
