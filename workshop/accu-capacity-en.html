   <h2> Simple Accumulator Capacity Meter </h2>

   <h3> What is accumulator capacity? How may you measure the capacity? </h3>

   <p> Capacity is electric charge
    <b> Q </b> of a new battery or
            a fully charged accumulator. Electric charge (amount of electricity)
            is measured in units Coulomb.
    <span class="formula">
     1 Coulomb
                = 1 Ampere &times; 1 second </span> . Usually capacity is measured
            in units
    <span class="formula">
     ampere&middot;hour </span> or
    <a title="1 ma-hour = 3.6 Coulomb">
     <span class="formula">
      ma&middot;hour </span> . </a>
    Normal capacity of
    <a href="accu-meter2.html">
     AAA </a>
    size accumulator is 1000
            ma&middot;hour, of
    <a href="accu-meter2.html">
     AA </a>
    size is 2000 ma&middot;hour.
            An accumulator of 1000 ma&middot;hour can deliver 1000ma current
            during 1 hour or 100ma during 10 hours. Total electric energy
            stored in accumulator is
    <span class="formula">
     E = Q &times;
                U </span> where
    <b> U </b> is voltage. </p>

   <p> To determine capacity of an accumulator firstly you need to
            full charge it. Then the accumulator is discharging with some
            current
    <b> I </b> . While accumulator is discharging the accumulator
            voltage is decreasing from initial V0 to voltage of full discharge
            Vmin. (Less voltage may damage accumulator) This moment the discharge
            should be terminated. Interval of time
    <b> T </b> , from start
            to end of discharge, and current
    <b> I </b> give us the accumulator
            capacity
    <span class="formula">
     Q = I &times; T </span> . Same
            way we may measure capacity of an (unchargeable) battery. After
            full discharge an accumulator it may be charged again, but battery
            may not be used. Capacity of the battery is capacity of the same
            new batteries of the same sort. Meanwhile capacity of alcaline
            battery is about equal to capacity of NiMh accumulator of the
            same size AA(2000 ma&middot;hour), AAA(1000 ma&middot;hour). </p>

   <h4> The scheme for measuring of capacity </h4>

   <p class="right">
    <img alt="Accumulator capacity
      meter within a clock, connector for an AA cell" height="100" src="200/clock-electric-timer.jpg" title="You may
      place the device into a clock" width="200"> </p>

   <p> The proposed scheme discharges an accumulator through a resistor
    <b> R </b> to a voltage approximately 1 volt that corresponds
            to "flat" cell. The current of discharge is
    <span class="formula">
     I = U / R </span> . To measure the discharge time interval
    <b> T </b> usual electric clock is used, which working voltage is
            1.5-2.5V. Solid state relays
    <a href="images/pvn012.pdf" title="pdf datasheet 200Kb">
     PVN012 </a>
    protects the accumulator from full discharge. It disconnects
            the battery when the voltage drops to
    <span class="formula">
     Ue
                = 1V </span> . </p>

      accumulator to 1.1 V and measures the time of the discharge." width="612"> </a> </p>

     <br> Accu meter in a charger </a> </p>

   <p> Charge an accumulator entirely, connect it to the device,
            set the clock to 0, and depress
    <b> Start </b> . The relay
    <a href="images/pvn012.pdf" title="pdf datasheet">
     PVN012 </a>
    opens the circuit when the accumulator voltage decreases to 1V.
            If you need the discharge current to be 1A, merely use the resistor
            R=1.2 Ohm. Carefully check the contacts. They may steal 0.1V or
            more, so the accuracy of the measurement decreases. </p>

   <p> If you only want to check your cells of AA or AAA size, it's
            a good idea to place the scheme in a case of a simple accu charger
            with good copper contacts like it is seen on the photo. </p>

    <p> FAQ </p>

    <p> <b> I need to measure capacity of an accumulator battery with
                    sum voltage 8.4 V. </b> <br> ANSWER: Use an adapter like that is shown on the picture.
                The two resistors should provide needed current. Additional resistor
                divides voltage to approximately 1V on R at the moment when we
                must terminate the discharge. </p>

    <p> <b> Indeed, I need the circuit to test one accumulator? </b> <br> ANSWER: Charge the accumulator, connect it to a resistor
     <b> R </b> and a voltmeter, then watch a clock. After some time
     <b> T </b> the voltage
     <b> U </b> decreases to "Voltage of
                almost full discharge" for this type of accumulator. This
                moment do disconnect the resistor. The capacity is
     <b> T*U/R </b> . </p>

    <p> <b> Why two diods? </b> <br> ANSWER: They and the resistor 5 Ohm prevent too big current
                through the relay. If you use only 1.2V cells, you may remove
                the diods from the circuit. </p>

    <p> <b> Why is the new circuit better than
      <a href="images/accu-meter-2004.gif">
       old circuit </a>
      ? </b> <br> ANSWER: (a) The clock gets 2.6-2.2V. (b) Both cells switch
                off automatically. (c) Two diods KC107A or C6041 (1.4V) prevent
                too big control current. </p>

    <p> <b> Is there a picture of wire-arrangement? </b> <br> ANSWER: I use the
     <a href="accu-meter-circuitry-en.html">
      very this Accumulator
                    capacity meter </a>
     once a year to check my 30-40 NiMh elements. </p>
