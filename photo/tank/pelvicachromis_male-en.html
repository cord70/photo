   <p> Kribensis or
    <i> rainbow cichlid </i> is interesting and smart
            african cichlid. A pair of kribs create family. They are careful
            parents however sometimes one of parents prefers guarding of its
            spawn by self, so it attacks as foreign fish as its mate. Kribensis
            fits to any common tank beyond the time when they rise their fry. </p>

     <b> Wiki: </b> </a>
    Pelvicachromis pulcher is a popular cichlid
            for aquarium. The species should be housed in volumes at least
            of 80&ndash;90 litres. Fine gravel should be used as a substrate, as
            the species likes to burrow and to excavate caves. Quartzitic
            substrates should be avoided as they interfere with larval development
            and may cause fry mortality. The aquarium should mimic the natural
            environment, and should be decorated with numerous caves, plants
            and hiding places. Dither fish are useful in reducing the innate
            shyness of the species. The species is an unfussy feeder and will
            accept a range of prepared foods, however in wild kribs mostly
            feed on plants. They spawn readily in captivity and will accept
    <a href="../../workshop/fish_home-en.html">
     artificial caves </a>
    as substitutes for the holes used for spawning in the wild.
            Although tolerant of a range of water chemistries, the species
            has a preference for, and is more likely to breed when, maintained
            in soft, acidic water. </p>
