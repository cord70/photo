   <h2> Auratus </h2>

   <p> Little auratuses and females are yellow. The male may be yellowish
            too when it gets a scare. No special condition is needed to breed
            the fish. When parents care their fry there should be caves or
            bushy plants where newborn fish may hide. </p>

   <p> One male and some females auratuses may be in a tank. If there
            are too many auratuses then at some age the strongest male depresses
            others. This auratus male forces other auratuses to hide in plants,
            and prevents they swim out even for feeding. In too small or too
            crowded tank all auratuses (males and females) may be killed by
            the strongest male. </p>
