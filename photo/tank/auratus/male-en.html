   <p> Auratus is quite aggressive. But if in an aquarium there are
      other fish, not auratuses, not african cichlids, not ones looking
      like auratus, then the auratus male doesn't attack them. Calm
      catfish, brave
    <a href="../botia_afternoon-en.html">
     botia </a>
    and crowd of
      barbuses live in common tank with auratus without problems. </p>

   <p> If gravel is about 2-8 mm size auratus may dig big holes in
      the ground down to glass bottom of the tank. Auratus carries small
      stones one by one from the hole to other place. So plants may
      float to the water surface, shells, stones and decorations may
      fall. They should be by a wide side down and should be digged
      deeper in the ground. </p>

   <p> Auratus likes
    <a href="../../../workshop/fish_home-en.html">
     caves </a>
    or
      bushy plants. Like
    <a href="../kribs-en.html">
     kribensis </a>
    and other cichlids
      auratuses lay their eggs within a cave. </p>

   <p> Auratus is a clever fish, its behavior is more interesting
      than behavior of restless barbuses or guppy. </p>
