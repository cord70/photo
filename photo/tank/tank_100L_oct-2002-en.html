   <h2> My 100 liter aquarium </h2>

   <p> For my tropical fish I made a
    <a href="../../workshop/fish_home-en.html">
     new tank cave </a>
    with big internal hollows and many comfortable holes. So
    <a href="kribs-en.html">
     cichlids found proper place for eggs </a>
    , and after they made spawn it was easy to save their fry.
            Barbuses also could rise upto sufficient size from eggs due to
            mutual small holes. </p>
