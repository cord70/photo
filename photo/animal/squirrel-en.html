   <p> The squirrel has half climbed on a pine-tree, stopped and
            see back to me. This photo was taken in Side (Antalia, Turkey).
            There were many big pine trees and a lot of red squirrels. </p>

   <p> It was quite uncommon for me. In Moscow I did'n see squirrels
            which may approach to you so close in wild. But I have pets, like
            squirrel, in my home - rat, sand mice, hamsters. :) </p>
