   <h2> Color of cat's eyes </h2>

   <p class="sel">
    Under flash light I have seen
    <br> Red and Yellow and Green </p>

   <p> Cat eyes in light of a photo flash lamp may be red, yellow
            and green. </p>

   <p> Using a photo flash lamp embedded in a camera we get
    <i> Red
                Eye Effect </i> - some persons on a photo have got red pupils
            of their eyes. It is because the camera sees a reflection of the
            flash lamp from red blood capillaries on the bottom of the eye. </p>

   <p> If the flash lamp is distant from the lens, or if by some
            reason the pupil of the eye is narrow, or the person doesn't look
            into the lens, then the eyes have got their normal color. </p>

   <p> Many cameras use a mode "red eye prevention". A
            bit of second before main flash a bright lamp (LED) or a slave
            flash lamp blinks. So pupils of human eyes become narrower. </p>

   <p> Instead of a flash lamp skilled photographers use bright diffuse
            illumination. They get nice soft shadows, and never get red eyes. </p>

      it a cobra?" width="200">
     <br> Snake in night </a> </p>

   <p> Animals have got red blood, too. On the photo one cat doesn't
            look into the lens, or maybe it has got narrow pupils of its eyes.
            So its eyes are normally green. </p>

   <p> One eye of other cat looks into the lens, and we see red color
            like on portraits of humans. The second eye looks some apart of
            the lens. So we see the mixture of two colors
    <span class="formula">
     red + green = yellow </span> . </p>

   <p> On we web there are many different photos of cat's eyes. But
            the effect you may see perhaps only at night photo with a flash
            lamp. </p>
