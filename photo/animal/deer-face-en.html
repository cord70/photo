   <h2> A deer </h2>

   <p> A herd's leader in a big Zoo of Rostov-on-Don, Russia. </p>

   <p> The herd of deer walks close to the fence. Deer allow us to
            touch them. The deer like communicate with people. They take leaves
            that we bring to them. Visitors merely break off branches with
            leaves from nearest willow trees. Surprisingly these trees remain
            like jungle every year. </p>

     <br> Desert lizard in Rostov's zoo </a> </p>

   <p> Rostov's zoo is one of the biggest at Russia's south. Many
            animals walk in spacious plots. Unfortunately tigers, lions and
            bears live in small cages. A white polar bear has got big home
            and a pool. There are many monkeys. Sometimes they bring new small
            human-like rostov citizens. </p>

   <p> Moscow also has got a good zoo, but it is quite incapacious.
            The best zoological garden that I saw was in Vienna. It is also
            the oldest zoo in Europe and it is one of the best for comfortable
            animal life. </p>
