   <p> The sparrow in the middle is a commander, left and right ones
            defend flanks. It seems the commander has got two tiny horns on
            its head. So it resembles an owl. On the side photo the horns
            seem are mere wet feathers. </p>

   <h3> A downy young sparrow </h3>

   <p> The yellow-bill sparrow stands in grass which is covered by
            cotton-like poplar fluff. This photo was taken in June 9, 2003
            by a camera Nikon cp4500. The camera is still alive in 2010. </p>

   <p> In Moscow our sparrows are very shy. So I could take the photo
            from quite a big distance about 2 or 3 meters with use a teleconverter
            3x. </p>

   <p> Modern cameras can do such work much better. Also modern sparrows
            are more brave and may jump just on your table in caffe. </p>
