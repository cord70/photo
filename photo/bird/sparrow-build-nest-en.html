     <br> Sparrow </a>
    carries many
    <br> worms at once to its kids. </p>

   <p> Once I saw a sparrow which held a bunch of green worms in
            its mouth. The worms were for the sparrow's kids. At this photo
            you see a young family of sparrows that starts building their
            new nest. They collect many blades of grass at once for the building
            were faster. </p>
