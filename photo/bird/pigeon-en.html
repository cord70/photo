   <h2> A pigeon at my balcony </h2>

   <p> There are pigeons living under our roof, and it is easy to
            photograph them. (They not only visit our balcon and refuse bins,
            they die near our house and possibly spread birds flu.) </p>

   <p> This one looks well. It sits symmetrically back to us, so
            we see both its legs. The pigeon turned its head halfside as Egyptian
            gods do. </p>

   <p> Many animals (say, cat) can turn their head at 180 degrees.
            Humans can less than 90. Perhaps it is because cat and pigeon
            must do selfcare (to clean its back), and human does this by hands. </p>

   <h4> At take-off </h4>

   <p> Flying up, pigeon flaps its wings forward like a swimmer.
            But when a pigeon starts its flight from a tree it spans its wings
            and merely jumps down. City pigeons hurt their legs jumping from
            hard artificial objects like roofs or metal masts because there
            are holes in the objects which are absent in tree's branches. </p>
