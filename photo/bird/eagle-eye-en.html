   <p> Don't worry, she is healthy. The eagle watches visitors of
            Moscow ZOO. </p>

   <p> You may notice a hole in the concrete block where is the eagle's
            beak now. If at every sunrise an eagle visits a huge rock and
            slightly abrades the rock then after a
    <b> million years </b> the rock is absent entirely. </p>

   <p> Let's check the story. Perhaps each time the eagle abrades
            the rock by 0.1 gram.
    <span class="formula">
     0.1 gr * 365 * 1000
                000 = 36.5 ton </span> It is about 8 cubic meters of stone. So
            the rock is about
    <span class="formula">
     2x2x2 meters </span> . The story is true. For
    <b> a milliard </b> years the eagle may
            erase a rock of
    <span class="formula">
     20x20x20 meter </span> size. </p>
