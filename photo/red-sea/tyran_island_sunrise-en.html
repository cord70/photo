   <p> To take such photography you should wakeup an hour before
            the breakfast. Numbers are arranged as a terrasse. Those rows
            of numbers that are closer to seashore are hided under trees and
            blossom. The far from beach the picturesque. The most top roof
            of upper terrasse is comfortable for skywatching. I had got a
            small telescope and here my children firstly saw the Saturn's
            ring and the Jupiters' moons. </p>
