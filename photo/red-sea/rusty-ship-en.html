   <p> This old ship is clearly visible from hotels Conrad and Baron.
            Tourists like visit it when they go to the coral reef near Tiran
            island. Daily about 100 small tourist's boats with 20-30 passengers
            visit the reef. I was here some times, too. Many photos of reef
            fish were taken here not so far from the ship. </p>
