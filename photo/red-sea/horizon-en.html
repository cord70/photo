   <p> Sun is close to sunset in this view. That is why the sea is
            so dark blue. </p>

   <p> The sea looks like others but it is very clear because it
            is calm and due to absence of rivers and rains. Also Red Sea is
            very warm. I was in Sharm-el-Sheikh in december and in february.
            These months are as attractive (or more attractive :) as 'warm'
            months. </p>
