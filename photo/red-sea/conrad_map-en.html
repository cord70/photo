   <h2> Conrad resort, satellite view </h2>

   <p> This view is from google-maps. You can see that immediately
            beyond the fence the desert begins. More russian resort
    <b> Baron </b> is on the left hand from
    <b> Conrad </b> (
    <b> Coral Sea
                Sensatori Resort </b> ). Baron is also green and well arranged
            inside its fence. Earlier the desert was everywhere on Sinai. </p>

   <p> Conrad is rather English and Italian resort. Who isn't interested
            with animation (like me) may love Conrad because it has free gim
            and there are a lot of silent zones where night noisy entertainments
            do not sound. There is a shop alley between Baron and Conrad.
            Here you can buy a mask or souivenires. </p>

   <p> Both hotels have got long shore with beautiful corals. Swimming
            with mask there I saw

            a lionfish by a usual camera through surface of water. (However
            normally it's windy there.) </p>
