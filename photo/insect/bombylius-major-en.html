   <p> <b> Wiki </b> : Bearing an extremely strong resemblance to
            bees their body is stout and furry, with the top of the thorax
            being black and shiny and the pile either brown, yellow, or white.
            They have long spindly legs as well as a long rigid proboscis
            found in the front of the head. Bombylius major mimic bees to
            allow them to get close to the bees burrow. When close, the female
            will flick the eggs into or near the nests of the host insects.
            The larvae are parasitoids which then feed on the food stored,
            as well as the young solitary bees or wasps. </p>
