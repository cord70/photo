     <br> Macro with a p/s camera </a> </p>

   <p> The photo is made by Nikon CP880, which minimal macro distance
            is 4 cm. Maybe I also used an
    <a href="../../workshop/HP-C200-en.html">
     additional 4x loupe </a>
    to increase the object. You see a transparent mosquito's abdomen,
            fine anatomy of legs and antennae. Blood fills only half of mosquito's
            abdomen. Mosquito's antennae have hair. The mosquito sits on the
            net of window tulle. </p>

   <p> The "Slim mosquito" is photographed through a loupe
            7x by old digicam HP C-200 in 2000. That camera had minimal macro
            distance 15cm, and it was focusing very slowly. </p>
