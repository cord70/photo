   <p> Pattern of black spots and form of wings resemble a bluebutterfly

            too. </p>

   <p> According
    <b> UK Butterflies </b> these two photos maybe a male
            and a female of one species. </p>

     UK Butterflies: </a>
    The Silver-studded Blue gets its name from
            the light blue reflective scales found on the underside of most
            adults and which are quite visible when light reflects off them.
            As with many other species of blue, the males are blue while the
            female is a less-conspicuous brown, although this butterfly is
            highly variable and several named subspecies have females with
            a certain amount of blue on their forewings. This delightful butterfly
            is found in close-knit colonies, with individuals rarely flying
            any distance. Most colonies contain less than a thousand adults.
            However, a few colonies are huge, with the number of adults measured
            in tens of thousands, providing an amazing spectacle. </p>
