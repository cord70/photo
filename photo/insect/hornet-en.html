   <h2> A hornet </h2>

   <p> (
    <i> Vespa orientalis </i> ) </p>

   <p> Some hornets build their nest among stones. Then they bring
            chips for the nest and food for their babies. On the photo three
            additional eyes are seen on the head of hornet.
    <i> Home fly </i> also has three additional eyes on its head. </p>

   <p> This species of hornets commonly lives in the Mediterranean
            area. That is why I snapped the photo on Rhodes island, Greece
            in August 2011. The hornet is especially known as very active
            during hot sunny days. It is quite easy to photograph them because
            of good lighting. </p>

   <p> From ancient time they say the dangerous hornet kills home
            bees. Perhaps the very this species is mentioned in the Bible
            (Exodus ch 23 verse 28): "And I will send hornets before thee,
            which shall drive out" </p>
