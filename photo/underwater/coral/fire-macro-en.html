   <p> The fire coral defends itself by tiny poisonous needles, like
            stinging nettle does. The first time when I touched the coral
            our guide wet my burns by specially prepared vinegar. Not sure
            it is the best means. The pain in the burn lasted a week yet and
            was seen some months. I didn't touch the coral later although
            I took photos of fish near such coral many times. I think the
            fish don't touch the coral too. If they do the tiny needles were
            broken. </p>
