   <p> The panorama includes big amount of sea and a part of the
            island. If I were you I had got a telescope here (I had :). The
            trees on the left and right are not specially choosed. There are
            many picturesque trees on the high pathway along the sea edge. </p>

   <p> Some artificial bays are made for tourists agaist bad weather
            and big waves at sea. It is not Red sea, so nobody swam with diving
            mask. I did. Not only far sea views are nice. Underwater there
            are a lot of interesting, too. I saw octopuses, crabs, morays. </p>
