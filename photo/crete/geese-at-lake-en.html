   <p> It is not so good with fresh water on Crete island. There
            are only few fresh-water lakes. So they show the lakes to the
            tourists. </p>

   <p> For tourists they do special

     "old style" ship </a>
    and a "moto-train".
            Meanwhile Crete has a lot of very interesting things which are
            of value per se without adapting for visitors. </p>

   <p> I swam with a diving mask in one of the lakes. Only tiny fish
            and a lot of plants were seen. </p>

   <p> There are big white geese at this lake. When I had prepared
            to photograph them they swam to me, hissing quite aggressively.
            They were not waiting for feed. The geese grasped my bread away
            trying bite me. I did run faster. </p>
