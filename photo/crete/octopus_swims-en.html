   <p> I didn't see big octopuses near the Creta-Panorama seashore.
            Small ones swim under our legs. Nobody was afraid of them because
            nobody had got a mask (I had). </p>

   <p> Octopuses chase crabs. There were a lot of crabs. Also I saw
            a moray, colorful christmas worms, and an odd very big (50cm)
            scary black worm which name is unknown (to me). The worm issued
            black ink like octopuses do. </p>
