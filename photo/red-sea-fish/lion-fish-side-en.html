   <h2> A lionfish near coral </h2>

   <p> Lionfish is very calm and not aggressive. When you approach
            it the fish moves quite slowly from you. Once I almost touch it
            by my hand but the fish was in rest. Perhaps it is sure that nobody
            can touch it. Actually, it is very dangerous! Big eyes say that
            it is a night fish. In day, when we see it, the fish probably
            is in sleepy mood. </p>
