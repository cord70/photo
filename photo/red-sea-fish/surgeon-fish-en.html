   <h2> Arabian Surgeon Fish </h2>

   <p> The surgeon fish is widely spread in tourist regions of Sharm
            el Sheikh. It often swims in shallow water where you may walk.
            I think the fish spawn here because it attacked me when I swam
            with my underwater camera in deep about 0.5-1 meter. </p>
