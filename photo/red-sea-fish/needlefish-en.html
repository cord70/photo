   <h2> Red sea Needlefish (Houndfish) </h2>

   <p> (
    <i> Tylosurus choram </i> ) </p>

   <p> Small shoals of the fish swim near the sea surface quite speedy.
            They look like common river fish - not so colorful as butterflyfish
            or other coral inhabitants. To make a shot it should slow running
            for a second. </p>

   <p> This fish has got a quite toothy mouth. Teeth are well seen
            from a distance. I read, the fish may pierce another fish by its
            thin toothy mouth. That is why the fish name is
    <i> needlefish </i> , not because it is so slim. Actually to catch small prey
            houndfish does fast side sweep motion by its thin beak. A lot
            of teeth helps to catch a small fish at high speed. </p>

   <p> Tylosurus is dangerous for human. With its size about 1 meter
            it may occasionally injure a fisherman by its thin toothy beak
            when the fish flies over water. </p>
