   <h2> Blue-spotted stingray </h2>

   <p> (
    <i> Taeniura lymma </i> ) </p>

   <p> This scat has got poisonous needles on its tail. It is better
            not touch it. Watching is safe and interesting. When the scat
            digs the ground hunting for worms many fish close to it in hope
            for easy feed. </p>

   <p> Taeniura lymma is wide spread in Red sea near Sharm el Sheikh.
            To see this fish you do not need to dive or swim far from the
            beach. Many scats swim out their day covers before sunset. You
            may see them near sand bottom, there they seek invertebrates.
            Small fish surround scat waiting for free food. </p>
