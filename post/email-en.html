   <p> I'm from 1955. The site was created in 1996. So we are quite
            old. </p>

   <p> The
    <a href="../en.html">
     photo section </a>
    of the site is updating
            about once a month, the section about
    <a href="https://cord70.github.io/cyber/en.html" title="Mechanisms">
     origin
                of consciousness and the physical world </a>
    is not updated for
            some years. </p>

   <p> I have had different photo cameras. They were Russian
    <i> Smena </i> ,
    <i> Zorky </i> ,
    <i> Zenith </i> . In 2000 I started
            using a digital camera
    <i> HP-C200 </i> , then
    <i> Nikon-cp880,
                Nikon-cp4500, Fuji-f30 </i> . They are quite good pocket-size
            cameras. </p>

   <p> I like photographing flowers, fish, bugs. Meanwhile usually
            I don't know their scientific or even popular names. Sometimes
            I refine names and change pages with the photos. </p>

   <p> In nearest plans I'd like to add some new underwater photos
            from Red Sea. Also for recent years I visited Rhodos and Vienna.
            There are some good photos about these sites. </p>
